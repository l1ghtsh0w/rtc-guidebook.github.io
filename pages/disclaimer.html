    As you can see, this is an Out-Of-Character disclaimer. You should have been given this disclaimer when you were inducted, but we will cover it again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here in the US Navy in SL (USNSL), we strive to be as realistic as possible. Recruit Training Command (RTC) is a <i>bootcamp environment</i>, meaning, but not limited to, the following:
    <ul class="frst">
      <li>you will be yelled at;</li>
      <li>your Recruit Division Commanders (RDC, indentifiable by the red ropes on their shoulders) will swear, but it will not be directed at you<sup>*</sup>;</li>
      <li>you will be made to perform physical activities, In-Character;</li>
      <li>you are expected to learn basic military bearing;</li>
      <li>you are expected to follow all orders given to you.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Know that this is <i>all</i> In-Character, and none of us have anything against you personally. Again, this is like bootcamp.
  </p>
  <p>
    We understand and know this can be stressful, so if you are feeling overwhelmed and you need a break, IM one of your RDCs and let them know. That being said, if you find yourself taking too many breaks, this may not be the RP for you. This is perfectly normal, as not everyone is cut out for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    By continuing with RTC, you agree that you have been given <i>no guarantee</i> that you will graduate, that you enter and participate in RTC of your own free will, and that you understand the above.
  </p>
  <sup>
    *You will hear things like "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?" but you will <i>never</i> hear "YOU FUCKING IDIOT!"
