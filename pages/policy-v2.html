     Below you will find basic policies for uniforms, and attendance &amp; absences. Make sure you have read and understood them both.

     <dd>
       During RTC, you will be expected to show up to class wearing the Uniform of the Day, which will be your Navy sweatsuit, which will be issued during induction. The only exception to this is if you went through DEP and are showing up for induction. In this case, you will wear the shirt you received during DEP. At the end of RTC, if you are caught up with your classes, you will be issued your NWUs, Enlisted Service Uniform, Utility Jacket for males or Pullover Sweater for females, and Dress Whites/Blues, as needed.
       <br /><br />
       During your career as a sailor, you are expected to wear your uniforms properly. This means having everything on your uniform in the correct place, <em>NEVER</em> wearing awards you haven't earned, and wearing the proper uniform at all times. Your RDCs and Instructors will help you with your uniforms during RTC, and others will continue helping with various uniforms as needed once you have graduated.

     <dt>Attendance &amp; Absences</dt>
     <dd>
       Recruit Training Command is one (1) week in duration, Monday–Friday, comprised of approximately two–three hours of class per day.
       <br />
       Officer Candidate School is four (4) weeks in duration, Monday–Friday, comprised of approximately two–three hours of class per day.
       <br /><br />
       Opportunities for class make-ups are generally available subject to RDC/instructor availability by appointment. However, it is the <strong>responsibility of the student to schedule these make-ups. NSTC RDCs/instructors are under no obligation to ensure that you graduate.</strong>
       <br /><br />
       While this is a roleplay that ultimately you are electing to participate in, please understand that the same goes for our instructors and recruit division commanders. Each member of our staff at NSTC has volunteered their time out of genuine enjoyment and a sincere desire to see others succeed and enjoy themselves as well.
       <br />
       As such, every officer candidate and recruit are expected to reciprocate the same effort in learning the material as graduation is not guaranteed if the candidate or recruit cannot retain and apply the material that is taught.
       <br />
       If you are unable to attend a scheduled class due to a real life obligation or emergency, the candidate/recruit must make every effort to notify the scheduled instructor/RDC or the <a href="secondlife:///app/agent/4919b983-1974-48fb-8b7a-cdb614c9998d/about">Ship's Officer</a> prior to missing the class to notify of the absence.
       <br />
       <div class="quote pol"></div>
       If a candidate or recruit incurs two no-shows/unjustified absences, he or she will be removed from the program.
       <br />
       If at any point during training, a candidate or recruit must withdraw attendance from OCS/RTC due to real life, they must notify the <a href="secondlife:///app/agent/613997e7-f260-47ee-b63e-9110dbc0d130/about">Commander of NSTC</a> to request separation or deferment to the next scheduled class or division. If the candidate or recruit elects to defer, he or she may do so <em>once</em>, but must start from the beginning.
