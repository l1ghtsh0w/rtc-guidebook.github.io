    Using the navigation links to the left, you can choose what you would like to read up on. However, it is recommended that you start with the <span onclick="changeContent('terms')" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Terms</b></span> and <span onclick="changeContent('disclaimer')" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Disclaimer</b></span> pages, and then move on to the <span onclick="changeContent('policy')" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Policies</b></span> page.

    With that being said, welcome to Recruit Training Command with the US Navy in SL. We hope you 'enjoy' your time here.
