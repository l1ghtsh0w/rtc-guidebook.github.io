  <hr />
  <p>
    This 'book' is designed to help you, a new recruit in the USNSL, survive and make the most of your time here during RTC.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the navigation links to the left, you can choose what you would like to read up on. It is recommended, however, that you start with the <span onclick="changeContent('disclaimer')" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Disclaimer</b></span> page.
  </p>
  <p>
    With that being said, welcome to Recruit Training Command with the US Navy in SL. We hope you 'enjoy' your time here.
