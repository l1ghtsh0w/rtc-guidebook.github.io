    Below you will find basic policies for uniforms and attendance/absences. Make sure you have read and understood them both.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>UNIFORMS</b>
    <p class="policy">
      During RTC, you will be expected to show up to class wearing the Uniform of the Day. For the first week, this will be your Navy sweatsuit. At the end of Week One, if you are caught up with your classes, you will be issued your NWUs, Enlisted Service Uniform, and Utility Jacket for males or Pullover Sweater for females. During Week Two, the Uniform of the Day will typically be NWUs unless specified otherwise in the Plan of the Day notice.
    </p>
    <p class="policy">
      During your career as a sailor, you are expected to wear your uniforms properly. This means everything on your uniform in the correct place, <b>NEVER</b> wearing awards you haven't earned, and wearing the proper uniform at all times. Your RDCs and Instructors will help you with your uniforms during RTC, and others will continue helping with other uniforms as needed once you have graduated.
    </p>

  <p>
    <b>ATTENDANCE AND ABSENCES</b>
    <p class="policy">
      During RTC, your RDCs and Instructors are graciously volunteering their time to teach you. They do not have to do this. As such, it is common courtesy to show up for scheduled classes on time. Remember, <i>on time</i> in the Navy means being <i>early</i>, typically by 15 minutes. So, if a class is scheduled for 1200, you should show up at 1145.
    </p>
    <p class="policy">
      We realize Real Life comes first. If you can not make it to a class due to RL circumstances, IM one of your RDCs and let them know <b>AHEAD OF TIME</b>, preferably as soon as you know you won't be able to make it. Failure to notify an RDC prior to the class will result in an <b>Unexcused Absence</b>. If you accumulate <b>three (3)</b> Unexcused Absences, you will be dropped from the program, and be given the option to try again during the next RTC session.
