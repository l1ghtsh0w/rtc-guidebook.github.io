    This 'book' is designed to help you, a new recruit in the USNSL, survive and make the most of your time here during RTC.

    Using the navigation links to the left, you can choose what you would like to read up on. It is recommended, however, that you start with the <span onclick="changeContent('disclaimer')"><b>Disclaimer</b></span> page.

    With that being said, welcome to Recruit Training Command with the US Navy in SL. We hope you 'enjoy' your time here.
