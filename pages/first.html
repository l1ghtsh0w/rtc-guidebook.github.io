  <hr />
  <p>
    Your first several days at RTC will undoubtedly be among the most difficult. You will be expected to learn quite a lot of material in a short amount of time:
    <ul class="frst">
      <li>basic military bearing:</li>
      <ul class="scnd">
        <li>greeting fellow personnel;</li>
        <li>saluting;</li>
        <li>wearing your cover;</li>
      </ul>
      <li>obstacle course;</li>
      <li>third class swim test.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Your RDCs understand it is a lot of information, and do not expect you to know things right away. After you have attended a couple of classes, however, it will be expected that you know the basics. You <span class="bold">will</span> make mistakesâ€”everyone who attends RTC does. How you handle these mistakes is what will make or break you. Learn from them, and you will be better for it. My friend once told me, after I did something wrong, <i>"Do not apologize. Learn from it and don't do it again."</i> The one difference here is that you <span class="bold">should</span> apologize, and correct your mistake.
