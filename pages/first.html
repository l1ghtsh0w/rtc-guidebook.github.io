    Your first week at RTC will most likely be the easier of the two, as you enter the program not being expected to know about military bearing. This being said, it still will not be easy. The classes for the first week are as follows:
    <dl>
      <dt><span class="bold">DAY ONE:</span> Physical Training Course Orientation</dt>
      <dd>On the first day, you will be introduced to the <span class="italic">Physical Training Course</span> (also known as the <span class="italic">Obstacle Course</span>). You will be given instructions on how to run the course, and be given time to practice several times.</dd>
      
      <dt><span class="bold">DAY TWO:</span> Military Customs and Courtesies</dt>
      <dd>On your second day, you will attend a class on <span class="italic">military bearing</span>, which is arguably the class with the most information. The reason this material is taught early on is due to how important it will be during your career as a sailor. It will dictate how you should act in a variety of situations in the Navy that you would otherwise not experience as a civilian.</dd>

      <dt><span class="bold">DAY THREE:</span> Third Class Swim Qualification</dt>
      <dd>On day three, you will be taken to NSO, to the pool, and given your <span class="italic">Third Class Swim test</span>. This is the most basic of the swim tests and <span class="underline">every</span> recruit must take and pass the test in order to become a sailor in the USNSL.</dd>

      <dt><spann class="bold">DAY FOUR:</spann> Medical Facility Overview & Recruit Physicals</dt>
      <dd>Day four consists of being introduced to the USNSL's main medical facility, <span class="italic">Mercy Hospital</span>, in NSO. While there, you will also get your first physical exams, inoculations, have blood drawn, and perform an eye exam.</dd>

      <dt><span class="bold">DAY FIVE:</span> Uniform Fitting</dt>
      <dd>On the fifth day of RTC, if you are on track with your classes, you will be issued your <span class="italic">Enlisted Service Uniform</span>, and your <span class="italic">Navy Working Uniform Type III</span>. Your RDCs and Instructors will help you fit them properly and get them squared away.</dd>
