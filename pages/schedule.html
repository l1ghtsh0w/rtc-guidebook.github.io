  <dl>
    <p>
      <dt>Physical Training Course Orientation</dt>
      <dd>You will be introduced to the <em>Physical Training Course</em>—also known as the <em>Obstacle Course</em>. You will be shown how to run the course, be given help where needed, and be told the rules to performing the test, which will take place at a later date. You will have plenty of time to practice in the coming days.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dt>Rank and Rate Recognition</dt>
      <dd>This class will teach you all you need to know about ranks, rates, the differences between them, and how to tell what someone's rank or rate is. This is important to learn early on; in fact, some people may say it's half of the job. Knowing ranks and rates will also help going in to the next class.</dd>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <dt>Military Customs and Courtesies</dt>
      <dd>Probably the longest and most information-packed class you will attend during RTC. It is also quite possibly one of the most important. You will learn about how to act during a variety of situations in the Navy that you would not experience as a civilian. This includes proper greetings, wearing your cover, when and how to salute, etc.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dt>Third Class Swim Qualification</dt>
      <dd>For this class, you will be taken to NSO and be introduced to the pool and the rules. You will then be given your <em>Third Class Swim Test</em>. This is the most basic swim test, and every recruit must take and pass the test in order to become a sailor in the USNSL. You will be instructed on how to take the test and be given a demonstration.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dt>Uniforms and Grooming</dt>
      <dd>Most likely the second or third most important class during RTC. You will learn about the various uniforms you will be utilizing during your career as a sailor, how to wear them properly, and where ribbons, insignias, etc can be found on each uniform. You will also be instructed on grooming standards that you are required to adhere to during RTC, and what is allowed after RTC.</dd>
    </p>

    <div class="quote"></div>

    <p>
      <dt>Medical Facility Orientation and Recruit Physicals</dt>
      <dd>You will be introduced to the USNSL's main medical facility, <em>Mercy Hospital</em>, located at NSO. Afterwards, each recruit will be given their first physical exams in which they will get their inoculations, have blood drawn, and receive an eye exam.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dt>Weapon Systems Familiarization</dt>
      <dd>This class will give you some background information about VICE. You will also attend a brief class about gun safety in which you will learn the four <em>main</em> rules of gun safety. You will be given a vest of body armor, be introduced to the shooting range, given a chance to practice, and be told about the marksmanship qualifications that you will take at a later date. Any recruit wanting to go into a career involving weapons—such as Master-at-Arms or SEALs—must pass both the rifle and pistol qualifications. You will have enough time to practice.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dt>Uniform Fitting</dt>
      <dd>This is when you will receive the two most worn uniforms for any sailor: <em>Enlisted Service Uniform</em> or <em>Peanut Butters</em>, and your <em>NWUs</em>. Your RDCs will help get your uniforms squared away and prepare you for uniform inspections. The proper way to report for uniform inspections is as follows:<br /><span class="example"><em>"Recruit &lt;First Initial&gt;. &lt;Last Name&gt;, service number &lt;service number&gt;, reporting for uniform inspection, &lt;ma'am/sir&gt;!"</em></span><br />You will be given your service number prior to the inspections.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dt>Anti-Terrorism and Basic Watch Standing</dt>
      <dd>This class will take place at the front gate of NSTC and will introduce you to the basic concepts of <em>Anti-Terrorism</em>. You will be shown examples of how terrorists pick their targets and how someone or some group of people might become a victom of an attack. You will also learn several measures that we, as a group, can take to ensure we do not suffer an attack and, if we do, how we can help minimize damages. In addition, you will be taught the basics of standing watch as a sentry, including how to start a watch, what to report, who to report to, etc.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dt>Physical Readiness Test</dt>
      <dd>This is when you will perform your test on the <em>Physical Training Course/Obstacle Course</em>. You will be given a couple of attempts. Afterwards, you will not be told whether you passed or failed, nor will you be told the requirements for passing.</dd>
    </p>

    <p>
      <dt>Marksmanship Qualifications</dt>
      <dd>You will be performing you qualifications with the rifle and glock that you recieved when you were introduced to the gun range. You will not be told what a passing score is. You will, however, be told whether you passed or failed each qualification.</dd>
